# 💼 Job Listing Portal

A professional, full-stack MERN application connecting top-tier talent with world-class organizations. Built with **Next.js 15 (App Router)**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The project follows a **Feature-Based Architecture** on the backend and uses a **Hybrid Auth Architecture** to facilitate seamless collaboration across different environments.

### Folder Structure
- **`frontend/`**: Next.js 15 application with a modern, glassmorphic UI.
- **`backend/`**: Modular architecture where each feature (auth, jobs, apps, profile) is self-contained.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Advanced Search**: Filter by keywords [title/company], location, and multiple job types.
- **Role-Based Experience**: Distinct dashboards and permissions for Candidates and Employers.
- **Real-Time Dashboards**: Instant statistics on applications, job status, and profile completeness.
- **Profile Management**: Structured profile builder with Cloudinary-powered file uploads (Logo, Avatar, Resume).
- **Silent Token Refresh**: Automatic session extension for a frictionless user experience.
- **SEO Optimized**: Dynamic metadata, robots.txt, and sitemap generation for maximum visibility.

## 🤝 Collaboration Workflow

We use a **Hybrid Workflow** to ensure security (no shared secrets) while allowing easy collaboration.

### Role 1: Frontend Developer (Zero Config)
- Connects automatically to the **Deployed Backend API**.
- Use production-like data without running any backend locally.

### Role 2: Backend Developer (Isolated Dev)
- Runs server against **Local MongoDB**.
- Uses **Remote Auth Verification**: Local backend trusts production tokens by verifying them against the lead server.
- Allows building features like "Profile" or "Jobs" locally while using "Auth" from production.
